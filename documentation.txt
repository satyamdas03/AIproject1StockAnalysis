steps:
1) setting up the environment 
    --> we are going to setup our pyproject.toml this is basically going to turn all the requirements of our project into code
    so that we can just run our install script basically to package and build all the necessary dependencies to run our python application
    
    --> we are gonna have to install poetry  ==> pipx install poetry
    --> before installing poetry, we are gonna need to install pipx ==> use : py -m pip install --user pipx
    --> we have to create our own pyproject.toml file
        --> there are 2 key components that needed to be set up first one is "tool.poetry" in which we need to define the core components such as the "name", "description"
        --> the other one is the dependencies where we are going to specifically call out which package conversions we need to set up crew
        all of the necessary stuff is written in the project.toml file
        -->tool.pyright is going to allow us to check python codes for type errors
        -->tool.ruff is going to check for errors and also styling issues
        -->build-system is going to poetry version 

2) next step is to open up the terminal and do "poetry install --no-root"

3) poetry env list --> to check the currently used Python version for your Poetry environment with

4) poetry shell --> enter into the poetry environment  
        # after this we will have a python environment in which we can work in
    
After this we can start working on the agents

======================================================

QUERIES TO BE ANSWERED:

1. Which model is this project using to train and all like ANN, or CNN or something else?
The project is not using traditional machine learning models like ANN (Artificial Neural Networks) or CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks). Instead, it leverages pre-existing AI tools and APIs to perform various tasks such as web scraping, financial calculations, and document analysis.

2. Which model would be optimal to train the model and get the output and why?
Given the nature of this project, which involves financial data analysis, market trend interpretation, and investment recommendations, a traditional machine learning model is not necessarily optimal. Instead, using pre-trained models and APIs like those provided by LangChain, SEC API, and other specific tools is more effective. These tools are designed to handle specific tasks like data scraping, document parsing, and embeddings for document similarity.

If you were to incorporate a custom model, you might consider:

Natural Language Processing (NLP) models for text analysis and summarization.
Time Series Analysis models for financial trend prediction.
Ensemble Models that combine multiple approaches for more robust predictions.
3. Is this project using an LLM (Large Language Model)?
Yes, the project utilizes LLMs through the LangChain library and specific tools like the YahooFinanceNewsTool and the custom agents defined in stock_analysis_agents.py. These tools and agents use pre-trained language models to perform tasks like summarizing web content, searching the internet, and analyzing financial documents.

4. Can LLM be added to the project title of this project name?
Yes, given that the project heavily relies on language models for various tasks, it is appropriate to include LLM in the project title. A possible name could be:

"LLM-Powered Financial Analysis and Investment Advisor"

This title reflects the use of Large Language Models in the project's functionality.

Summary of the Project's Approach:
The project leverages various pre-trained tools and APIs to perform its tasks, without the need for traditional machine learning models like ANN or CNN. The integration of LLMs through LangChain and specific financial analysis tools forms the core of the project's analytical capabilities.


## WHAT IS THE ADVANTAGE OF USING LLM MODEL OVER ANN OR CNN

Using an LLM (Large Language Model) like YahooFinanceNews for tasks in your project offers several advantages over traditional models like CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) or ANN (Artificial Neural Networks). Here are some key advantages:

1. Natural Language Understanding
LLM: LLMs are designed to understand and generate human language, making them particularly well-suited for tasks involving text processing, summarization, and information extraction. They can comprehend context, identify relevant information, and produce coherent summaries or analyses.
CNN/ANN: These models are generally used for image processing (CNN) or basic pattern recognition tasks (ANN). They are not inherently equipped to understand or generate human language without extensive preprocessing and additional layers.
2. Contextual Analysis
LLM: LLMs can analyze text by considering the context and nuances of language, enabling them to provide more accurate and meaningful insights. This is crucial for financial news analysis, where understanding context can significantly impact the interpretation of data.
CNN/ANN: These models do not have an inherent understanding of context in text data. They would require complex architectures and additional layers to approximate the contextual understanding provided by LLMs.
3. Pre-trained Knowledge
LLM: Models like YahooFinanceNews are often pre-trained on vast amounts of text data, including financial news and reports. This pre-training provides them with a substantial knowledge base, enabling them to generate insights and summaries based on a broad understanding of financial markets and news.
CNN/ANN: These models typically require extensive training on specific datasets for each new task. They do not come with pre-trained knowledge and would need a substantial amount of labeled data to achieve similar performance levels.
4. Flexibility and Versatility
LLM: LLMs are versatile and can be fine-tuned for a variety of tasks, such as summarization, sentiment analysis, and question answering. This makes them highly adaptable to different types of text-based tasks in financial analysis.
CNN/ANN: These models are more specialized and less flexible. While they can be adapted for various tasks, they generally require more significant modifications and additional training data to switch tasks.
5. Ease of Integration
LLM: Integrating LLMs into applications like financial analysis tools is often straightforward due to the availability of high-level APIs and pre-trained models. This can accelerate development and deployment.
CNN/ANN: These models might require more extensive custom development and optimization to achieve similar performance in text-based tasks.
Specific to Financial Analysis
LLM (YahooFinanceNews): This model is specifically tailored for financial news analysis, making it particularly advantageous for extracting and summarizing relevant information from financial reports, news articles, and market analyses. It leverages its training on financial data to provide insights that are directly applicable to stock analysis and investment strategies.
CNN/ANN: These models would need to be extensively trained and adapted to handle the specific nuances of financial text data. This involves more effort in data preprocessing, feature extraction, and model tuning.
Conclusion
In summary, using an LLM like YahooFinanceNews offers significant advantages in natural language understanding, contextual analysis, pre-trained knowledge, flexibility, and ease of integration for text-based financial analysis tasks. Traditional models like CNN and ANN, while powerful in their domains, are not as well-suited for the complexities of language processing and would require substantial modifications to achieve comparable performance.
